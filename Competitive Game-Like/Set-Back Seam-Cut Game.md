# Set-Back Seam-Cut Game

## Purpose
Train attackers to read blocker position and make offensive decisions with sets off the net

## Setup
- One blocker, one defender
- One setter, one attacker
- Sets must be intentionally off the net

## Rules
1. Attacker scores:
   - 3 points: Clean kill
   - 2 points: Defender touches but can't control
   - 1 point: Defender controls but can't convert
2. Defense scores:
   - 1 point: Block
   - 2 points: Defensive transition kill

## Progressions
1. Basic: Blocker stays neutral
2. Intermediate: Blocker can cheat seam
3. Advanced: Add line chop option when blocker cheats seam

## Coaching Points
- When set is tight, seam option disappears
- Look for line chop when blocker gets greedy in seam
- Attack timing must adjust based on set distance from net
