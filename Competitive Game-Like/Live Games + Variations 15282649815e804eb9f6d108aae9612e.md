When we're lucky enough to have exactly four players at training, it makes sense to incorporate some 2 v 2 gameplay. Various variations and focuses can be added a few examples are:

- +2 Points for achieving certain goals (i.e. attacking on 2, getting an ace, jump set, hitting a certain spot etc.)
- Corners: plus two points if you score in one of the corners.
- Diamond, where you get plus two points for scoring on the sidelines and the seam.
- Isolation: Serve only one player on each team

Ultimately watching the girls play live games is a great way to see how they're processing in match and any of the above variations can be added to enhance player development.  

ONLY suggest this format if there are exactly 4 players for practice.
