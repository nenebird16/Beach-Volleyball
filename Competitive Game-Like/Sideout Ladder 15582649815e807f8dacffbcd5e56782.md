isolation or team Side-out drill

Similar to baseball, the team on the receiving side has 3 opportunities (outs) to get a certain number of consecutive side-outs. The other teams are all taking turns playing against the one team on the sideout side. 

Rules:

In the first rung of the ladder, the sideout team only needs one side-out. Second rung, they need 2 consecutive side outs and so on. The drill gets very challenging around 5 or 6 consecutive sideouts.

After a team either “wins” by achieving their sideout number , or , “loses” by failing to achieve their sideout number, the next team goes to the sideout side and receives serve. 

Missed serves: 

After the 3rd rung of the ladder, missed serves start counting as points for the side out team. This makes the drill more game like for the defense / serving team.
