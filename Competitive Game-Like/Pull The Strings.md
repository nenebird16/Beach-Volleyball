# Pull The Strings

## Purpose
Train attackers to recognize and exploit defensive positioning by using sets intentionally off the net

## Setup
- One blocker, one defender
- One setter, one attacker
- Sets must be intentionally off the net

## Scoring System
- 10 total attempts per round
- Maximum possible score: 20 points (10 clean kills)
- Track scores against this standard to measure progress
- Note drill level when recording scores

## Progressions

### Level 1: Zone Control
- No defense
- Two target zones: seam and cut
- +2 points: Hit in designated zone
- +1 point: Hit in court but outside zone
- 0 points: Error

### Level 2: Add Defender
- Defender active between zones
- Blocker stays on line
- Clean kill: +2 points
- Defense touches but can't control: +1 point
- Error or defense digs easy: 0 points

### Level 3: Full Defense
- Blocker free to move (seam/line)
- Blocker can peel on off-net sets
- Same scoring as Level 2

## Coaching Points
1. Set Quality
   - Must be intentionally off net
   - Consistent height allows attacker to time
   - Communication between setter/attacker

2. Strategy + Cataloging
   - Establish strong line attack first
   - Force blocker to respect line threat
   - Only then can seam/cut options open up
   - Use errors to continue to set up the defense

3. Attack Decisions
   - Tight set = no seam option
   - Watch blocker movement pre-contact
   - Adjust timing based on set distance
   - If defense looks neutral, pick an attack and commit with confidence

4. Vision Keys
   - Timing: Stay behind ball to create natural vision windows
   - Cataloging: Look for defensive patterns you've established
   - Vision Science: Using central vision for ball tracking while peripheral vision detects defender movement
      - Rely on peripheral motion sensitivity
      - Let neural circuits process defender movement automatically
      - No need to look directly at defense

5. Common Errors
   - Soft approaches: Always plan to attack aggressively from behind the ball; only adjust if defense is deep
   - Poor timing: Getting under the ball eliminates both power and vision options
   - Meat head swings: Hitting directly at defender instead of using court zones strategically
   - Understanding the purpose: This drill teaches relationships between attack zones and developing intelligent attack patterns
