# Practice Plan - February 4, 2025
**Athletes**: Jenna, Morgan, Lydia
**Focus**: Visual-dominant attacking with live blocking

## Recent Athlete Feedback Integration
- Jenna (Last update: Jan 15) - Working on A/B swings against defense
- Morgan (Last update: Jan 15) - Strong comfort swinging off-net, working on attack vision

## Warm-up Phase (20 mins)
1. 🏃‍♀️ Dynamic Movement Prep
2. 🎯 Partner Pepper with Visual Cues
   - Partners face each other with blocker showing different positions
   - Attacker must call out and hit to opposite side of block position
   
## Build-up Phase (30 mins)
1. 🔄 Stationary Block Vision Work
   - Blocker shows position early
   - Attacker works on reading and responding
   - Progression: Add delayed block movement

2. 🏐 Moving Block Recognition
   - Add approach for attacker
   - Blocker starts neutral, moves to line
   - Focus on visual processing during approach

## Main Game (45-60 mins)
**Setup**: 
- Jenna alternates between attack/setter roles
- Morgan and Lydia as blockers
- 10 opportunities per rotation

**Scoring System**:
- Blocked ball: +1 for blocker
- Hitting error: -1 for attacker (ball replayed)
- Kill/tool: +1 for attacker
- Soft block: +0.5 for blocker
- Cover on tight set: Wash/replay

**Progressions**:
1. Basic: Blocker shows early
2. Intermediate: Blocker moves during approach
3. Advanced: Blocker can fake line and move angle

## Notes
- Focus on testing A/B theory in game-like situations
- Emphasis on visual processing during approach
- Blockers maintaining discipline on line blocking
