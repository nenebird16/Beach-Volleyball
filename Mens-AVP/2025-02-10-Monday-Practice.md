# Monday Practice - February 10, 2025
**Athletes:** Nate, John, AJ, Chris
**Time:** 2 hours

## 1. Short Court Games (40 mins)
### Speed Short Court 2v2 üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- 12x12 court size
- Regular scoring to 7, win by 2
- Winner stays, loser rotates
- Start with Nate/John vs AJ/Chris

### Cross-Court Vision Game üëÄ
- Must call shot before attack
- Extra point for successful "no-look" shot
- Teams must verbalize defensive coverage

## 2. Offensive Pairings Training (80 mins)

| Round | Attack Side | Visual Cue | Location 1 | Location 2 | Nate | John | AJ | Chris |
|-------|-------------|------------|------------|------------|------|------|----|----|
| 1 | Left | Blocker | Seam | Hard Line |  |  |  |  |
| 2 | Right | Blocker | Seam | Hard Line |  |  |  |  |
| 3 | Left | Defender | Seam | Sharp Cross |  |  |  |  |
| 4 | Right | Defender | Deep Angle | Sharp Cross |  |  |  |  |
| 5 | Left | Live Defense | All Open | All Open |  |  |  |  |
| 6 | Right | Live Defense | All Open | All Open |  |  |  |  |

### Scoring System
**Constraint Rounds (1-4):**
- -1: Error/block/direct to defender
- 0: In court but missed zone
- +2: Kill in designated zone
- No +1 available - focus on zone accuracy only

**Live Defense Rounds (5-6):**
- -1: Error/block/direct to defender
- 0: Dug with dive
- +1: Kill or successful tool (rewarding tactical decisions)
- +2: Kill in designated zone

### Round Setup (13 mins each round):
1. 1 min: Explain constraint/zones
2. 2 mins: Each attacker gets 1 practice attempt
3. 8 mins: Score tracking (5 attempts per player)
4. 2 mins: Quick feedback/rotation to next setup

**Rotation Order for Attempts:**
- Each player completes all 5 attempts before switching
- Order: Nate ‚Üí John ‚Üí AJ ‚Üí Chris
- Non-hitting players rotate through blocking/defense

## Post Practice Reflection - February 10, 2025

### Overall Session Assessment
- Challenging practice with mixed results
- Strong start with board blocker rounds
- Significant difficulty emerged during defender rounds

### Scoring System Innovation
During practice, implemented new scoring system:
- +3 points: Beating blocker down the line
- +2 points: Beating defender cross-court
- +1 point: General kills

### Key Insights
1. **Blocker Containment Strategy**
   - System effectively incentivizes pinning blocker to line
   - Opens up offensive opportunities elsewhere
   - Good framework for strength-based gameplay

2. **Defensive Positioning**
   - Need to develop better strategies for defending between line and line seam
   - Potential for cross-court variation of containment game

### Future Implementation Ideas
1. **Constraint-Based Games**
   - Develop two distinct games focusing on defensive positioning
   - Emphasize outside-in defense
   - Include "hit between the wickets" defensive scenarios

2. **Competition Integration**
   - Move towards implementing as competitive drilling
   - Use as preparation for actual match scenarios
   - Focus on seal/contain line gameplay

### Areas for Development
1. **Cross-Court Variations**
   - Explore scoring system for cross-court containment
   - Consider defensive strategies for low cross hits
   - Work on block evasion techniques (poke/cut around)
