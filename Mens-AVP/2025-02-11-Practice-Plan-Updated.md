## Coach's Reflection

### Key Insights from Today
- Jake McNeil identified ineffective wind-side strategy (chop sharp seam + high line)
- Better approach: high deep angle into wind corner → choppy low line/around/over block line
- On bad side (wind behind): drive deep + short line (rogey) > chop cross
- Technical note: reduce kicking out on bad side

### Strategic Understanding
The offensive pairings work as complementary systems:
1. Deep angle + short line
2. Chop down + high line/seam
These pairings create pressure by working counter to each other, effectively covering all court zones.

### Next Steps
1. Design isolated drill focusing on deep angle → short line (rogey) combination
2. Create specific training block for high deep angle → choppy low line sequence in wind
3. Once these sequences are solid, integrate into game-like scenarios with wind conditions

These progressions will help players internalize the correct strategic choices based on wind conditions.
