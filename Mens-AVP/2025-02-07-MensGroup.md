## Key Insights & Coaching Notes

### Vision Priority Discovery
- Blocker vision proved more critical than defender vision
- Key Concept: "Beat the blocker first, earn the right to beat the defender"
- This hierarchy should inform approach and decision-making sequence

### Equipment Notes
- Used plywood as blocker board
- Recommendation: Switch to boogie board material
  - Firmer than foam block
  - Softer than plywood
  - Better for sustainability and safety

### Future Format Recommendation - Validation Round Structure
3-Ball Progression:
1. Beat the blocker
2. Beat the defender
3. Live play - beat either

Group Size Flexibility:
- Minimum: 3 players
- Maximum: 6 players
- Roles can rotate through server, attacker, blocker/defender

### Score Analysis
Notable Patterns:
- Higher success rates against defender vs blocker initially
- Improved blocker board scores in later rounds (adaptation)
- Side preference evident in individual scores
- Maximum possible score per round: 10 points (5 attempts Ã— 2 points)

## Next Practice Recommendations
1. Implement validation round format
2. Source better blocker board material
3. Consider adding combined blocker+defender scenarios
4. Track both successful attacks and attack selection quality
