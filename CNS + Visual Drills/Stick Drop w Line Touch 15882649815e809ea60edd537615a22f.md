This warm-up drill involves partners dropping a stick in the middle of the court. They required to let the stick almost touched the ground, and then bring it back vertical before releasing it and touching the line as theyâ€™re running back to touch the line, their partner is dropping the stick bring it back up and releasing it.

I like this drill because it has a lot of range of motion, gets the legs warm, and has a reactivity component.
