# Women's AVP Practice Plan - February 11, 2025

## Pre-Practice Focus Points
- Jenna: Building on A/B vision breakthrough (Jan 15)
- Ashley: Back in rhythm, focusing on platform (Jan 14)
- Lydia: Integrating with group dynamics

## Mindset + Primer
"Control what you can control, master your decisions"
Focus: Building offensive decision-making through progressive shot combinations

## Warm-Up (15 min)
- **(1) Awareness Building: Hitting off a box against a live defense** 

Players practiced offensive pairings by hitting off a box, with three players forming a defender-blocker combo for digging and warm-up hitting. The offensive player focused on experimenting with pairings using the defensive player’s ability to defend their shots as feedback to see whether their technique is “readable” or deceptive. 
The defender / blocker used the reps to warm up into full speed hitting.


- **(2) Pass -&gt; Set -&gt; Hit: Set -&gt; Hit: Modified hitting lines with visual stimulus & “beer pong” scoring (no defender, focus on accuracy)**
- This was an awesome way to get them warm and prepped for the competitive portion of practice

- **(3) Pass -&gt; Set -&gt; Hit: with Live Defender, Offensive Pairing - Deep Angle/Short Line(30 min)**


   Players practiced hitting with a defender, aiming for specific zones. Scoring system: +2 for hitting designated zones, +1 for kills in court, -1 for errors, or hitting DIRECTLY at the defender. Maximum score of 10 in 5 opportunitie

## Coach's Post-Practice Reflection

### Modified Hitting Lines Format ⭐
**Setup & Flow**
- Coach initiates with freeball over net
- Uses blocker board for variable block stimulus
- Players rotate through hitting positions

**Progression**
1. Warm-up Phase (3 reps per player)
   - Unscored
   - Focus on form and timing

2. Competitive Phase
   - Game to 3 points
   - Point awarded for hitting designated zone
   - Rebuttal system activates after first point scored

**Rebuttal System ("Beer Pong" Rules)**
- If Player A hits zone, Player B must respond with zone hit
- Successful rebuttal continues rally
- Failed rebuttal = point for Player A
- Creates extended quality rep sequences when both players are accurate

**Scoring Example:**
```
Player A: Hits zone (+1)
Player B: Must hit zone to stay alive
- If successful: Rally continues
- If misses: Player A wins point
First to 3 points wins round
```

### Key Themes & Learning
1. Offensive Pairing Development
   - Focus on opposite corner targeting (cut shot/high line, baby line/jumbo)
   - Emphasis on wind-based problem solving
   - Building shot selection adaptability

### Progression Effectiveness
1. Box Drill with Live Defense
   - Successful for awareness building
   - Players used defensive feedback to gauge shot deception
   - Good foundation for understanding readable vs deceptive techniques

2. Live Defense Implementation
   - Scoring system (+2 zone, +1 kill, -1 error/defender hit) created clear feedback
   - 5 opportunity cap with max 10 points provided good measurement framework

### Technical Focus for Next Practice
1. Continue developing wind-based offensive strategies
   - Chop shots into wind
   - Conservative deep corners with wind
2. Expand on offensive pairing concept with specific wind condition scenarios
3. Maintain focus on deceptive techniques vs readable shots

### Recommendations for Next Session
1. Start with modified hitting lines format - proved effective for building confidence
2. Keep the rebuttal scoring system - encourages precision
3. Consider adding wind-specific targets to zone scoring
4. Maintain defender feedback component - crucial for shot development

## Areas for Progression
1. Add specific wind condition scenarios to the Queen of the Court format
2. Develop more complex offensive pairing combinations
3. Integrate serving patterns that complement offensive strategy
