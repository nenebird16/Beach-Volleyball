Short - deep triangle is A really good warm-up drill on tournament day, traditionally I do it with most of my teams because it gets them setting and passing a variety of different looking balls Which results in a lot of variability and therefore challenge.

The drill set up is just like every other triangle setting drill, but instead of the coach just wrapping a down ball to the player passing, the coach passes up to themselves once and then passes a free ball either in the first third of the court, short, or the back corner of the court, deep. The passer either moves forward and descends to pass the short ball, a super realistic game pattern, Or, has to open their hip and pass on their sideline deep. The intention with the short ball is for the passer to be able to pass a hittable ball to their partner to initiate the spread offense or option. And on the deep Ball, the intention is to pass the ball still 5 to 10 feet off the net. The deep ball is a little more for the Setter because it produces a pass. That’s a lot more difficult to handle. This can be done as a flow drill, but it can turn into a burner pretty fast because there’s little to know downtime.

This drill can be done With as little as Two players and a coach, up to six players and a coach. With six players, you would have three players on each side. The players would initiate the drill in the coaches role while the coach stepped out. 

The focuses of this drill are to simulate the flow of a game and to warm the players, legs, hands, and skill up.

Any specific type of offense can be focused on or a variety of different set selections can be chosen. When there’s wind present, make sure to do a back set to the wind side. This will become tactically very important in the match, so don’t forget to warm up your setting and passing in the most difficult conditions. Make sure to orient the set so that the hitter hits into a maximum one angle, this often means running a back set To open up more of the cross court, an angle into the wind. for offenses that rely heavily on an option, make sure to warm up the short pass option shovel along the net jump set back to the hit or play. The spread offense. This will be some of your teams, bread and butter throughout the match. let’s get it grooving.
