With 3 people:

- Blocker -  initiates a free ball over the net to the passer , then, either blocks the setter (on 2) or releases to block the hitter. The variability in this blockerâ€™s decisions are the basis for the drill. Have them start simple and early with their moves , professing to game like situations at the end
- Passer - the passer has a pretty passive role in this drill after passing the first ball. The can attack the ball that has been set , or just catch it.
- Setter - the drill is designed to improve the setters ability to make a decision to set or attack based on what the blocker does. If the blocker fronts the setter , they should jump set their partner , but if the blocker does NOT front the setter , they should attack to open space.

Variations:

- Level 1: to begin, just rep out the jump set without the blocker . Most players will need some reps building technique without the visual stimulus at first
- Level 2: the blocker makes simple and early moves, that are easily perceptible to the setter. This stage helps the setter establish some confidence in their vision and begin developing visual skill
- Level 3 : keep score and make it competitive. Blocker scores any time they get a touch .
