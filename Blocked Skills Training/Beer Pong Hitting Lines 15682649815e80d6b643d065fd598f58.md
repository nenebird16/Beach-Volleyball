Category: Skill Development
Intensity: Medium
Format: Rotate
Skills: Hitting, Shot Selection, Visual Processing
Min Ppl: 4
Max Ppl: 8
Objective: Hitting Accuracy, Block Reading
Round Type: Points
Min Rounds: 3
Max Rounds: 6
Min Minutes per Round: 5
Max Minutes per Round: 8
Equipment: Blocker Board, Zone Markers
Framework: Competition
Feedback: Shot Selection, Approach Timing, Block Reading
Initiation: Coach Freeball
Winning Criteria: First to 3 points with rebuttal option

Why:

This hitting drill combines traditional hitting lines with a competitive scoring system that incentivizes accuracy. The rebuttal format creates natural pressure situations while maintaining high rep counts. Players must hit accurately to "win" and extend their hitting rounds, creating a self-motivating environment where consistent accuracy leads to more opportunities.

Set Up:

1. Regular court setup with clearly marked hitting zones
2. Coach near net with blocker board
3. Players in hitting lines on one side
4. Balls ready for coach to initiate with freeballs
5. Optional scoreboard for tracking points

Execution:

1. Warmup Phase (3-5 mins):
   - Each player gets 3 unscored warmup reps
   - Focus on proper approach and technique
   - Coach provides technical feedback

2. Scoring Games:
   - Games played to 3 points
   - 1 point for hitting designated zone
   - Rebuttal system in effect after warmup
   - Players rotate after winning or missing rebuttal

3. Rebuttal System:
   - If Player A hits zone, Player B must respond
   - Continued exchanges until someone misses
   - Miss = opponent wins point
   - Win by hitting 3 zones without opponent matching

Variations:

- Difficulty Levels:
  - Beginner: Static block, larger zones
  - Intermediate: Moving block, standard zones
  - Advanced: Random block, smaller zones, time pressure

- Block Variations:
  - Static block position
  - Delayed block movement
  - Random block patterns
  - Multiple block looks

- Scoring Modifications:
  - Different point values for different zones
  - Time limit on rebuttal
  - Must win by 2 points
  - Bonus points for consecutive hits

Coaching Points:

1. Technical Focus:
   - Early block recognition
   - Strong approach angles
   - Contact point awareness
   - Balance through swing

2. Common Errors:
   - Late approach timing
   - Poor zone awareness
   - Rushing shots during rebuttal
   - Inconsistent approach pattern

Success Metrics:
- Zone hit percentage
- Length of rebuttal sequences
- Quality of approach and technique
- Decision-making speed

Notes:
- Keep pace quick between reps
- Monitor fatigue in long sequences
- Adjust zone sizes based on skill level
- Encourage strategic shot selection
