Category: Skill Development
Intensity: moderate
Format: Rotate
Skills: Sideout, Vision
Framework: Decision Making, Visual Focus

- Blocker Vision:
    - If the blocker pulls, attack at the blocker’s line / seam
    - If the blocker is up early, shoot over them and short / deep
    - If the blocker is late, swing quick off their hands for a tool
- Defender Vision:
    - Defender playing deep → Triggers a short chop or cut shot
    - Defender pulled in → Deep swing , or jumbo
    - Defender playing the seam → Swing to the perimeter
    - Defender playing perimeter → Hi-line to corner or seam swing

Variations:

- With 6 players or MORE, this can be done in a rolling format — as a “High Line Pepper”. Where if the blocker stays up, the attacker shoots “hi-line”, but if the blocker pulls, the attacker takes a swing at them.
