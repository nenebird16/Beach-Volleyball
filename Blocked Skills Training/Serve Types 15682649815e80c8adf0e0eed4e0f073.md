There are MANY types of serves, it is my responsibility as a coach to make sure my players are passing all of these many types of serves when we are practicing passing. Usually I can knock out 2 -4 of these locations per practice. 

Servers should also practice serving these various types / locations of serves to have a fully equipped tool kit.
