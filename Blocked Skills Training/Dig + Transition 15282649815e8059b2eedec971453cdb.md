When there's only two or three players at practice, or sometimes 4, it makes sense to drill defense with the coach initiating. With four or more players it can be slow to have a coach initiate a defensive drill. In this case it's often better to set up a side out vs defense Drill that challenges more players and leaves less players unengaged and sitting on the sideline.

An exception to this would be if I'm explaining a new concept or demonstrating specific technique that we want to use later on

The dig transition drill is set up with one blocker and one defender, the coach is inputting a ball either off a box or off a jump and the defender digs and transitions. Variations of this include digging only for reps, but it's nice to get transition attacking in as well. Digging for reps is good for establishing touch and if and if the player is looking for a lower impact practice the transition attacking is optional.

In this drill players rotate through the defensive spot ticking between 2 and up to 10 defensive reps depending on stamina and number of athletes our practice.
