Loop deluxe is a blocker move where they jump for the block then after landing make a big push move to dig a pokey or short roll shot. This push move often involves a full layout and requires great skill and timing, generally playing the ball pretty low to the sand. Is a fundamental skill for blockers to develop and identify and can be very effective against shooters.
